  In this project I was tasked with creating a brand-new design of an outdated
  website. I made enitre design in
  <a
    class="hyperlink"
    href="https://www.figma.com/file/NOipZUdkLuIsyJ1JW9mAsT/Apartmani-Ane"
    target="_blank"
    >Figma</a
  >.
  <br />
  I also made a logo for the site. I had to keep in mind that website has be
  both aesthetically beautiful and user-friendly.

  I was given the assignment of creating a WordPress website after pitching a design.
It was quite simple to replicate all the components in WordPress because it was my design.
